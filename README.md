## How the App Works

* This app is designed to display motivational posters for the user. Upon page display, a randomly built poster will display on the page.<img width="1262" alt="Screen Shot 2021-02-15 at 11 58 54 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75390410/107977332-ed282a80-6f88-11eb-8a4c-c3c9575c6591.png">

* On page refresh, another poster will be displayed. If the `Show Another Random Poster` button is clicked, another random poster will be displayed.<img width="1214" alt="Screen Shot 2021-02-15 at 12 27 55 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75390410/107977577-53ad4880-6f89-11eb-9fc9-a6d30884e6cb.png">

* Click the `Make Your Own Poster` button to go to the Create Your Own Poster page. On this page the user can enter their own message, title, and image URL. When the `Show my poster` button is clicked, the app will display a poster with the user inputs. The user submitted data will be stored and used to create other random posters.<img width="893" alt="Screen Shot 2021-02-15 at 12 00 51 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75390410/107977643-70e21700-6f89-11eb-8c22-f42e32097fca.png">

The saved posters can be viewed by pressing the `Show Saved Posters` button.<img width="912" alt="Screen Shot 2021-02-15 at 12 01 40 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75390410/107977742-9c650180-6f89-11eb-9a61-1fc7469ea292.png">
